# django_blog
In this repo I am logging my practice with the Django framework  by building a fully featured web app.
My experience so far has been using flask, so this is my first django commit.
I will be following along with parts of Corey Shafer's code on youtube to ensure use of best practices and to accelerate the learning process.
