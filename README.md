Practicing Django by building a fully featured web app. 

In this repo I am logging my practice with the Django framework. 

My experiance so far has been using flask, so this is my first django commit. 

I will be following allong with parts of Corey Shafer's code on youtube to ensure use of best practices and to accellerate
the learning process.
